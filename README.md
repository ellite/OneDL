## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Install Python

Make sure **Python 3** is installed:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If it's not installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or install it using your system’s package manager.

### 2. Install Required Package

The only required external Python package is `requests`. Install it with:

```bash
pip install requests
```

> Use `pip3` if you're on a system where `pip` refers to Python 2.

### 3. Download the Script

Download `OneDL.py` directly from GitHub:

```bash
curl -o OneDL.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ellite/OneDL/refs/heads/main/OneDL.py
chmod +x OneDL.py
```

### 4. Make It Globally Accessible (Optional)

To make `onedl` available from any folder, create a hard link:

```bash
sudo ln OneDL.py /usr/local/bin/onedl
```

Now you can simply run:

```bash
onedl
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Run the script:

    ```bash
    onedl
    ```

2. Choose how to provide your links:
   - Load from a file
   - Paste manually
   - Use a debrid service

3. If using a debrid service:
   - Select Real-Debrid, AllDebrid, Premiumize.me, TorBox, or "Find best option"
   - Paste your magnet, hoster, or HTTP(S) URL when prompted

4. Select specific files (if applicable), and OneDL will download them to your current folder.

ALLDEBRID_API_TOKEN = "your_alldebrid_token"
PREMIUMIZE_API_TOKEN = "your_premiumize_token"
